# Runescape Project One
My first attempt for a goal checker for Old School Runescape.
Using the knowledge learned from my Java course/s, I am going to make a Runescape Goal Tracker. This will be used for my personal Runescape Character but I intend for others to use this eventually too.

# Features:
- Personal Goal Setting:
I intend to implement user input into the output. I would like this to retain previous entered information and recollect when run. The user will enter their current goal, and future goal/s, and declare when it has been completed.

- XP Calculator:
I intend to add a few XP methods into this project, creating a rudimentary XP calculator. While this will not have all the XP methods in the game, I will be sure to include the most effective and fastest methods. I will also ask for user input on current XP and calculate how many actions are left before hitting 99. The total experience required for a 99 in any skill is 13,034,431.
